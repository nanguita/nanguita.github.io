I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge in the Computational and Biological Learning Lab, supervised by Flavia Mancini and Andrew Saxe (Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit).

Prior to this, I completed an MEng in Mathematics and Computer Science at Imperial College London, focusing on machine learning and statistical theory. My master thesis was on deep learning theory under the supervision of Pedro Mediano, Cl√©mentine Domine, and Andrew Saxe.

This site hosts my publications, talks, teaching materials, projects, and blog posts.
