I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Cambridge in the <a href="https://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk">Computational and Biological Learning Lab</a>, supervised by Flavia Mancini (Cambridge) and Andrew Saxe (at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/life-sciences/gatsby">Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit</a>, UCL). My research is motivated by a broad interest in understanding the principles of intelligence—both artificial and biological. In particular, I study which properties of human and animal brains support continual learning, and how these insights can be applied to the development of artificial systems.

Before my PhD, I completed an MEng in <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/undergraduate/mathematics-computer-science-meng/">Mathematics and Computer Science</a> at Imperial College London, where I focused on machine learning and statistical theory. My thesis on deep learning theory, supervised by Pedro Mediano, Clémentine Domine, and Andrew Saxe, led to a first-author publication at ICLR 2025.

Alongside my academic work, I am deeply interested in the applications of AI to industry and society, particularly in advancing safe and responsible AI, as well as its potential in fields such as medicine and drug discovery.
